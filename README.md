Pick Out Your Pick Up

Pick Out Your Pick Up is a site that enables restaurant owners to list their business information and menus so site users can in turn learn about their restaurants and leave a rating and/or review.

The rating aspect of the site is designed to provide recommendations for restaurants and menu items based on reviews. All user ratings are compiled to generate an average rating, then the highest are displayed on the "Top Rated" page.
